# image_splicer
You need to install Pillow and Python 2.7

Just throw as many images as you want into your input directory of choice and the script
will resize all to largest image's dimenstions splicing them together to form one image.
You have the option of horizonal or vertical slicing and picking random slices or sequenced slicing.

I hate readmes.
