# image_splicer
You need to install Pillow and Python 2.7

Just throw as many images as you want into your input directory of choice and the script
will resize all largest images dimenstions and splice them together into one image.
You have the option of horizonal or vertical and picking random slices or sequenced slicing.

I hate readmes.
